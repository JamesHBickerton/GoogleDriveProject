# GoogleDriveProject

This is now my second web design project. I know that this won't be responsive as of yet as I am still going through the course at the moment (I'll probably end up editing these and re-uploading a more responsive design when I get the knowledge). I found out with this project that starting with Flex Grid is much easier for me to visualise a page's layout. From there, I can combine Flexbox to make a decent(ish) layout. 

I uploaded the link from the page here - https://fantastic-lollipop-b45f19.netlify.app/

Can't wait to see how much better I can get these.
